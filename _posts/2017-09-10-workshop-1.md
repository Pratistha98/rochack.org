### Version Control with Github!

![Workshop 1](http://amueller.github.io/sklearn_tutorial/octobiwan.jpg)
`git commit -m "Add workshop 1"`

Starting off for the year, we went over the basics of Github.
First we went over how to add yourself to the RocHack website by sending
a simple pull request. If you missed it, you can check out the slides
[here][slides]. After that, we went into how you can sync a project
on your computer with Github to keep it on the cloud and keep track of
every version. I'd love to do another, more advanced Git workshop
in the furutre!

### Git setup tips

If you are downloading git, you can here it [here][git].
You can also find the GitHub website [here][github].
Once you create a new repository on the GitHub website, you can sync it
with a local project by opening a terminal/command line in your project
directory and following these steps:

1. git init
2. git add .
3. git commit -m "first commit"
4. git remote add origin linkToProjectOnGitHub
5. git push -u origin master

Then every time you need to update your respository you can just type:

1. git add .
2. git commit -m "commit message"
3. git push

Thanks to everyone who came out to our first meeting of the year,
and I look forward to seeing everyone again!
