### Python in Jupyter Notebooks!

![Workshop 2](https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7388996?v=4&s=400)
`jupyter notebook`

In our second workshop we covered an introduction to Jupyter Notebooks, 
an incredible tool used to write Python and display some great visuals 
within your actual code. Jupyter Notbooks are a very popular way of writing
a sort of report with code and displaying information you extract from data.
Notebooks are especially helpful to know about if you are doing any sort of data science
or machine learning. You can actually see a cool example of a [report][ligo] LIGO 
wrote up on discovering gravity waves, that uses Jupyter Notebooks.

### Jupyter Notebook setup tips

The easiest way to get Jupyter notebooks up and running, I think, is by 
installing a package for scientific Python libaries. My personal choice is
[Anaconda][anaconda]. It's easy to install and has a lot of useful tools.

If you have pip/pip3, you can also use it to install Jupyter Notebook 
by putting the following into a terminal:

1. 'pip3 install --upgrade pip'
2. 'pip3 install jupyter'

To launch Jupyter, just enter 'jupyter notebook' into a console after it's 
installed

Thanks to everyone who came out to this week's workshop!
I can't wait to start getting into projects next!
